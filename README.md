# Logistics-project
Smart Logistics Optimization using Data Analytics  OptiFlow Logistics Co. | Tools: MySQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy), Statistics, Power BI  Project Overview: Analyzed logistics operations data to identify root causes of shipment delays, optimize fleet utilization, and improve demand forecasting for a mid-sized logistics provider.

# Key Contributions & Achievements:     
Performed data extraction and transformation from MySQL database using SQL and SQLAlchemy .       
Conducted EDA and statistical analysis in Python to uncover delay patterns and operational inefficiencies.    
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor KPIs — on-time delivery %, top delay reasons, asset utilization, and forecast accuracy.       
Identified that traffic congestion and weather conditions contributed to 65% of delays.      
Recommended route optimization and asset scheduling improvements, projected to reduce average waiting time by 18%.     
Presented actionable insights to management with clear data storytelling and visual reporting.       

# Impact:     
Improved operational visibility and decision-making; enabled proactive resource allocation to reduce shipment delays and enhance delivery performance.  

# Conclusion:  
The analysis of OptiFlow Logistics’ operational data reveals several key insights into shipment efficiency, asset utilization, and customer behavior.  
Exploratory Data Analysis showed that shipment delays are influenced by multiple factors — including traffic congestion, weather conditions, and warehouse waiting times — rather than a single numeric variable.   
 The correlation heatmap further confirmed that there are no strong linear relationships, highlighting the complex and multi-dimensional nature of logistics operations.  

Statistical analysis and Power BI dashboards identified that heavy traffic and weather issues are the leading causes of delays, while under-utilized assets contribute to inefficiencies and cost overruns. Additionally, customers with higher purchase frequency and transaction amounts experience better delivery reliability, suggesting that operational focus on high-value customers can enhance satisfaction and retention.  
Overall, the company’s current challenges stem from a combination of operational, environmental, and resource-management factors.
